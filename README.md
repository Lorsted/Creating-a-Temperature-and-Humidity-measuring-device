# Creating a Temperature and Humidity measuring device

Written by : Alexander Laskowski â€“ al226nd
 
The purpose of this project is to be able to measure the temperature and humidity and with the help of wifi it will be possible to transfer the measured values to adafruit and later display these values using graphs. This is a project for beginners, and it should take approximately around 3-4 hours to complete the project.

## Objective

I have chosen to build this device because I thought it would be an interesting starting point to IoT and it filled a need which I had at the time as I was curious about the difference between temperature and humidity in rooms connected to each other. These measured values could be used as a starting point as to identify which rooms need to be better ventilated.

## Material

| Name  | Purpose | Name of Vendor | Price (SEK) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Raspberry Pi Pico WH  | Single board microcontroller with wireless function and headers soldered.  | Electrokit  | 109  |
| DHT11  | This sensor measures the Temperature and Humidity of the surrounding.  | Electrokit  | 49  |
| Breadboard | A simple device designed to let you create circuits without the need for soldering.  | Electrokit  | 69  |
| Jumper wires M-M | Used in order to connect the components.  | Electrokit  | 49  |
| Micro USB cable | The cable is used in order to connect the computer to the microcontroller and enabling both charging and the transfer of the program used. | Electrokit  | 39  |


In this project we use the Raspberry Pi Pico WH, it is a versatible piece of equipment with more than enough pins in order to complete this project.

The sensor used in order to measure the temperature and humidity is the [DHT11](https://pages.github.com/).
